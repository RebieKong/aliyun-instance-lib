## What we are going to do
Using this lib, you can controll cloud instance's life circle.
- It will support not only aliyun and qcloud but aws and other cloud services.
- It will support not only Linux but Windows.
- It will support not only a common server but some container service.
- It will support not only command but windows.
- [What's More?](https://github.com/RebieKong/cloud-instance-lib/issues/3)

But currently, we focus on aliyun esc.
